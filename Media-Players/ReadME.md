I developed my 1st Web based media player in 1997 as a way to better understand accessing data over networks and the web. In those days I could run it as part of the Windows Desktop page. Although a lot of functionality has been lost due to growing security issues over the years, I have only ever played my Music Videos and MP3s using modified versions of my original Media Player.

Eventually I developed an IOS version that uses WebSQL as the database for links to my music files and after that a new Windows version that uses IndexedDB. My main wish was to have the USB stick I could access over a wifi dongle have a database on it that I could update directly and it seems that the new .net core 5, Blazor and host of Microsoft web based applications may finally give me that function.

Although both the WebSQL and IndexedDB versions work with my Samsung Galaxy Tab I still get the best performance on my iPhone, iPad or Windows laptops. Plus I get to listen to my whole collection once before resetting the has been played field to 0 and then over and over again specified by what ever SQL or IndexedDB filtering I wish to apply:D
