IPI Media Search.hta has been added, as I found a lot of issues in later versions of edge with trying to get lists of files on the computer running IndexedDB. By using IPI Media Search.hta you can select the folders you wish to pull the list from then simply copy the list and paste it in to the Text Editor field of the Media Player before running the Create iFrame Table Element from Editor.
