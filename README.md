IPI Database Copy and Search.hta is a hypertext application written mostly in VbScript with a little JavaScript and PHP thrown in for good measure. It utilises ADODB connections and recordsets to Source data from Microsoft Excel; Access; SQL Server CE; SQL Server LocalDB; and SQL Server. Although PHP Object Oriented MYSQLI is used to source and alter MySQL, and PHP PDO for SQLite databases, a Wscript Shell with a mix of ADODB Streams and Recordsets are used to structure the data for sourcing functions. The SQLite database functions also can utilise a separate wrapper as described in the accompanying readme pdf.

IPI Excel Connection.ps1 is a Windows PowerShell Script that provides an Ms Access Query Function like approach to connecting to Excel and CSV files from a single form. It uses Grid Views to filter and display the result sets. It also uses a -ComObject initially to populate a list of Named Ranges and worksheets populating the Filter Grid View with the selected Named Range or Worksheet's Column Names and Data Types. Please see the accompanying ReadMe pdf.
